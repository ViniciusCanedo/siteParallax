# Parallax

Welcome to the Parallax project! This project is designed to train the
implementation of the parallax effect using only HTML and CSS.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a visually stunning web page
with the parallax effect. Parallax scrolling involves the background moving at a
different speed than the foreground, creating a sense of depth and immersion. By
implementing this effect, we aim to enhance the visual appeal and user
experience of the webpage.
